1. What is the difference between Named export, Default export and * as export?

We can have only one default export per file. We can import the default import with any name.

Named export is useful to export many values. We have to use the same name when importing the component.
Ex: export const MyComponent;
Ex: import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';

import * as AllComponents from "./Mycomponents" - is used to import all the named component onto an object. We can use any named component as follows:

AllComponents.MyComponent1
